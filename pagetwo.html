    <p>Pulse: 78</p>
    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <p> Okay, today is my first day of dong this exercise. I am a little tired of school now, so I wanna start to do the practice for relaxing my mind a little bit. I’m gonna sing a song that I listen a lot recently from my favorite Chinese language Singer, JJ Lin. Since I am not in very good mood today, I will sing his sad songs. I am kind of excited now because I have never done this kind of practice for a class assignment. I mean.. I do love to sing, but I don’t know what ’s gonna happened. I will do that anyway. And probably, I will sing different songs from him..</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pulse: 90</p>
    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <p> I have never thought about my pulse would go up about 12, because when we do the exercise in the class, I did not see any changes. I guess it’s because I am doing the things that I have a lot passion in. However, I feel a little tired because I continued for 15 mins, it’s like I just ran 1km. I tried to sing following the original songs, it’s about four songs. Well.. I do feel more relaxed now than before.</p>
